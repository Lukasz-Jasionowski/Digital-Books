# Digital Books

Digital Books is a fully functional full-stack web application that serves as a digital library of sorts, offering a unique perspective on books. Built using React, Node.js and MongoDB, the project aims to provide users with the opportunity to explore a curated collection of books through reviews, descriptions, and ratings.  
  
The application is designed to offer a seamless user experience with distinct sections:

• Home
• Books
• About

The core functionalities:

• Adding New Books: Users have the capability to contribute to the digital library by adding new books. This feature ensures that the collection remains current and diverse, fostering a sense of community engagement.

• Editing Books: Users who are part of the digital library's community can enhance the information associated with existing books. This ensures accuracy and relevance in the provided content.

• Deleting Books: While the digital library doesn't enable book borrowing, users can remove books that are no longer relevant or accurate, maintaining the quality of the collection.
